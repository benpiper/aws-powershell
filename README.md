aws-powershell

## Cross-platform PowerShell scripts for doing cool things with AWS VPC, ELB, and Route 53.
### PowerShell Core: it's not just for Windows anymore!

#### AWS PowerShell SDK setup:
If you don't already have the AWS PowerShell SDK installed, [install-awspowershell.ps1](install-awspowershell.ps1) has got you covered. It will detect your PowerShell edition (Desktop or Core) and install and import the appropriate AWS PowerShell module.
```
. ./install-awspowershell.ps1
```
I recommend using [Visual Studio Code with the PowerShell extension](https://benpiper.com/2017/08/visual-studio-code-as-a-powershell-integrated-scripting-environment/). It works on Linux, Mac, and Windows!
